Installing and running itSIMPLE
-------------------------------
To install itSIMPLE you just have to unzip the file and run the .jar file
(e.g., java -jar itSIMPLE.jar). Sun Java 6 Runtime (or up) is required.


			
Connecting planners to itSIMPLE.
-------------------------------

itSIMPLE can communicate with most available planners. The source comes already
with some planners such as metric-ff (both windows and linux). For the others
planners it is necessary to download them from the authors website and make a
copy of the executable file (and all required files) an put it in folder
myPlanners/. The name of the executable files must correspond to what is
specified in a file use by itSIMPLE. The file itPlanners.xml
(resources/planners/itPlanners.xml) holds information about each planners that
itSIMPLE can communicate with. The following list show the name of 
files treated by itSIMPLE:

- metric-ff.exe  http://www.loria.fr/~hoffmanj/

It is necessary to compile the source for some of them, depending on the OS
(Windows, Linux, Mac).
