Connecting planners to itSIMPLE.
-------------------------------

itSIMPLE can communicate with most available planners. The source comes already
with metric-ff (both windows and linux). For the others planners it is necessary to
download them from the authors website and make a copy of the executable file 
(and all required files) an put it in folder myPlanners/. The name of the executable 
files must correspond to what is specified in a file use by itSIMPLE. The file 
itPlanners.xml (resources/planners/itPlanners.xml) holds information about each 
planners that itSIMPLE can communicate with. The following list show the name of 
files treated by itSIMPLE:

- metric-ff.exe  http://members.deri.at/~joergh/ff.html

It is necessary to compile the source for some of them, depending on the OS (windows, linux, mac).
