The itSIMPLE Project aims to study and develop a Knowledge Engineering tool for designing AI Planning & Scheduling (P&S) domain models. The tool has been designed to give support to users during the construction and design cycle of an intelligent planning and scheduling application. Such design cycle includes phases such as domain specification, modeling, analysis, model testing with AI planners and maintenance, all of them crucial for the success of an P&S application.
