=_Use Case Diagram_ =

A _Use Case diagram_ of _itSIMPLE4.0_ project, captures _Use Cases_ and relationships among _Actors_ and the _system_. It describes the functional requirements of the system, the manner in which outside things (_Actors_) interact at the system boundary, and the response of the system.

Select _Use Case diagram elements_ and _connectors_ of the _Use Case Diagram Tab_ (2:). You most before select _Use Case Diagram- choice in left panel _Manage projects_ for the this project (1:):

=== Actor ===

An _Actor_ is a user of the _system_; user can mean a human user, a machine, or even another system or subsystem in the model. Anything that interacts with the system from the outside or system boundary is termed an _Actor_. Actors are typically associated with _Use Cases_.

For create an _Actor_ with _itSIMPLE_ tool, you must click on the _Actor_ icon (https://itsimple.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/resources/images/Modeling/UseCase/actor.png) at the toolbar and choose on the _Diagram View Area_ where you want put it.

According to the problem context, you can personalize actors, selecting different icons in the _Properties Object_ panel:

It is always useful to choose some [Icons icon] to the actor, because this gives a better interpretation to your _Use Case Diagram_.

In the [BasicFuncionalities#Object_Properties Object Properties panel] you can define some other properties like a _name_ and a _brief description_ of the actor. 

=== Use Case ===

A _Use Case_ is a _UML_ modeling element that describes how a user of the proposed system interacts with the system to perform a discrete unit of work. It describes and signifies a single interaction over time that has meaning for the end user (person, machine or other system), and is required to leave the system in a complete state: the interaction either completed or rolled back to the initial state.

For create an _Use Case_ with _itSIMPLE_ tool, you must click on the _Use Case_ icon (https://itsimple.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/resources/images/Modeling/UseCase/useCase1.png) at the toolbar and choose on the _Diagram View Area_ where you want put it.

In the [BasicFuncionalities#Object_Properties Object Properties panel]  you can define some other properties:
  * Base tab: You can specify a _Name_ and _Description_ of this _Use Case_.
  * Contraints: After you have defined the base in the properties, you can specify the _Constraints_ of this Use Case. In the bottom section of this panel will appear four news tabs: https://itsimple.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/resources/images/Modeling/UseCase/constraintCU.png
    # The first tab (https://itsimple.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/resources/images/Modeling/UseCase/ucpre.png) is Pre-Conditions where you can define the pre-conditions of this use case. This constraint answers the question: What do I have to specify as pre-conditions for this use case to work?
    # The second tab (https://itsimple.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/resources/images/Modeling/UseCase/help.png) is Post-Conditions where you can define the post-conditions of this use case. This contraints answers the question: What do I have to specify as post-conditions, which will be the result of this use case.
    # The third tab (https://itsimple.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/resources/images/Modeling/UseCase/ucinv.png) is for Invariants, where you can define some invariants of this use case. Invariant is a predicate that will always keep its truth value throughout a specific sequence of operations.
    # And the last one tab https://itsimple.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/resources/images/Modeling/UseCase/uctemp.png) is for temporal constraints 
  * Further Details tab: For specify additional information.
  * Flow of events tab: Flow of events is a part of the plan, which will be generated by a planner.

You can see a resume of the use case specification better in the _Information Panel_.
 
==== Association ====

An _Association_ (https://itsimple.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/resources/images/Modeling/association.png) refers to how individual use cases can be linked together based upon certain functionality. 

For define an association with _itSIMPLE_ tool, you must first click on the actor where you want define the association and after click on the use case to complete the association.

=== Dependency ===

In _UML_ modeling, a _dependency (https://itsimple.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/resources/images/Modeling/UseCase/dependency1.png) relationship_ is a relationship in which changes to one model element (the supplier) impact another model element (the client).

For define an dependency with _itSIMPLE_ tool, you must first click on the actor where you want define it, and after click on the use case to complete the association.
