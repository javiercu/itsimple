You can add your own icons to the itSIMPLE and use them in the Usecase, Class, State Machine diagrams. In order to add an icon just paste it into the folder: itImages\Icons. We recomend to use .png icons (48x48, 32x32).

== How do I add a planner to itSIMPLE? ==

itSIMPLE is integrated to several AI planner such as Metric-FF, FF, SGPlan, MIPS-xxl, SATPlan, LPG-td, LPG, hspsp. In order them to work properly you have to download the planners (check README.txt) that are not distributed with itSIMPLE and paste them in the folder 'myPlanners/'. Open the file itPlanners.xml (located in resources/planners) and check the file name that you have to use.

If you wish your planner were connected to itSIMPLE or if you would like to see a planner integrated to the tool, please send us an email (tiago.vaquero (at) poli.usp.br) so we can help you with that. In fact, we just need to properly register the planner in a specific file (itPlanners.xml).
