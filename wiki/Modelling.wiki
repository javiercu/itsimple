Modeling can be described as graphically representing a  software system. The resulting model can be used to emphasize a certain aspect of the system being represented, and to record, document and communicate its detail. A study of such a model can enable insight or understanding of the planning system.  *itSIMPLE4.0*'s modeling platform is based on the _Unified Modeling Language_ (*UML*), a standard that defines rules and notations for specifying business and software systems. 

*itSIMPLE4.0* proposes a special use of *UML* in a planning approach (named *UML.P*) which we believe can contribute to the knowledge acquisition process (from different viewpoints) as well as to the domain model visualization and verification.

The environment was designed to incorporate a toolset (representation languages and theories) capable of dealing with requirements and knowledge engineering.

Some of the *UML diagrams* can be directly applied for planning domains such as _use case diagram_, _class diagram_, and _state chart diagram_ for each project (see in left panel Manage project *Newproject1* diagrams).
