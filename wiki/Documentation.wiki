= Introduction =

The *itSIMPLE* (_Integrated Tools Software Interface for Modeling Planning Environments_  was designed to give support to users during the construction of real and complex planning domain applications mainly in the initial stages of the design life cycle. 

These initial stages encompass processes such as domain specification, modeling, model analysis and model testing, all of them crucial for the success of the application. *itSIMPLE* is an open source project implemented in Java that presents a enhanced integrated environment with well-known representation languages such as:
 * UML (_Unified Modeling Language_),
 * XML (_eXtensible Markup Language_), 
 * Petri Nets and 
 * PDDL (_Planning Domain Definition Language_) 
Each one of them with its best contribution to the whole design process.

The main purpose of these languages is to lead designers from the informality of real world requirements to formal _domain models_. Starting with *requirements elicitation*, *specification* and *modeling*, *itSIMPLE* proposes a special use of _UML_- in a planning approach (named _UML.P_) which contribute to the knowledge acquisition process as well as to the domain model visualization and verification
