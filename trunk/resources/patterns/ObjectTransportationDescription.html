<h1>Object Transportation</h1>

<h2>Intent</h2>

The purpose of the pattern is to model cargo objects that are carried by transporter agents on a map of locations.

<h2>Scenarios</h2>

Consider a logistic domain in which trucks and airplanes must move and fly in a network of locations in order to pick up and delivery different packages to customers. The packages (cargo) are moved and transported to their destinations (location) by trucks and airplanes (carrier). In an elevator domain, an  elevator (carrier) carries people (cargo) from one floor to another (location). In an airport network, airplanes must carry people between airports. In a daily port activity, ships must load and unload cargo from and to distinct offshore platforms. The Transportation pattern provides a base modeling solution to these scenarios by encapsulating the knowledge about and behavior of cargo, transporter and location objects so planning strategies can be used to deliver cargo to their respective destination, under the desired performance. 

<h2>Applicability</h2>

Use this pattern when cargo objects have be loaded, carried and delivered to their corresponding destinations by transporters. Different topologies of locations, including their connections, where transporter navigates can be applied in this pattern.

<h2>Model Representation</h2>

A class <i>Locatable</i> represents all objects that can be located at a <i>Location</i>, including <i>Cargo</i> and <i>Carriers</i>. A class <i>Cargo</i> (also called Portable) represents the type of objects that are transported by <i>Carriers</i> through a network of <i>Locations</i>. The class <i>Carrier</i> represents the type of agent objects that can move and travel around different locations while carrying cargo objects. <i>Cargo</i> (e.g., packages, boxes, people, food, goods, oil) can be loaded to and unloaded from a <i>Carrier</i> (e.g., vehicle, truck, airplane, ship, spacecraft) so it can transport them to different locations. The class <i>Location</i> represents the map sites, places where locatables, carriers and cargo objects might go and be at. The way location objects are connected to each other depends on the desired model: it can represent for example a map (e.g., city map) or a sequence of locations (e.g., sequence of train stations).

<h2>Elements, Participants and Roles</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Locatable</b> (Class). The class of objects that can be located at a Location.</li>
<li><b>at</b> (association). The relation between a Locatable (a Carrier or a Cargo) and a Location that specifies where the locatable object is located.</li>
<li><b>Location</b> (Class).  The nodes of a directed graph (e.g., a map site or a node in a sequence of nodes).</li>
<li><b>connected</b> (association). The edges of a directed graph representing the accessibility between nodes, locations.</li>
<li><b>Carrier</b> (Class). The class of objects that can move around the map and can carry cargo objects.</li>
<li><b>move</b> (operator, action schema). The operation that makes a carrier go from one location to another.
<li><b>load</b> (operator, action schema). The operation performed by a carrier to load a portable.
<li><b>unload</b> (operator, action schema). The operation performed by a carrier to unload a portable. 
<li><b>Cargo</b> (Class). The objects that are carried by carriers.</li>
<li><b>in</b> (association). The relation between Cargo and Carrier that specifies in which transporter object is the cargo.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Metrics</h2>

Transportation problems may have different metrics such as travel distance and total fuel used by carriers. This pattern provides a base for more complicated transportation problem where these metrics might exist. For the encapsulate model described here, the usual metric is the number of occurrence of the action move in the plan (which provide the sense of the distance traveled by carriers), or even the number of actions in the plan (a very traditional and simplistic way to measure the quality of plan in AI Planning). Depending on the planning strategy used to solve the problem (especially not optimal ones), the resulting plans for transportation problem might contain undesirable loop, either in the path of carriers or in the load-unload activities. For example, plans with load-unload loops of the same cargo in a given location are not desirable, as well as loops in the path of carriers and no load or unload activities in between. 

<h2>Consequences</h2>

This pattern does not consider the capacity of the carrier. If there is a capacity constraint on how many cargo objects each carrier can carry (e.g., the weight, area, space) this pattern must be extended accordingly. The pattern allows to represent different topological maps (e.g. each location is connected to all the other locations). Defining the multiplicity of the association connected constraints the way locations are associated to each other, constraining therefore the accessibility on the map. It is general enough to cover several graph configurations.

<li>Depot domain (IPC-2)</li>

<li>Ship Operations in Petroleum Ports and Platforms (transporting equipments and cargo from ports to offshore platforms)</li>
<li>Transporting passengers to their destination airport</li>
</ul>

<h2>Related Patterns</h2>

The Object Transportation pattern can be seen as an extension of the Move & Reach pattern (a mobile object moving in a map of location to reach a certain site). It is also commonly combined with the Volume Transfer pattern when carriers have to carry, for instance, liquid products (in one or several containers); this combination can also encompass the cases in which carriers have fuel capacity and must be refuel from a fuel source (e.g., gas station) or even share fuel with other carriers on the way.
