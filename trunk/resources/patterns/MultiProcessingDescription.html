<h1>Multi-Processing</h1>

<h2>Intent</h2>

This pattern aims to represent the problem of processing different part using a poll of machines transferring. The part must to be alter or change stages given a set of machines and their particular capabilities. The goal can be either achieve a specific desired state (values of properties) of the part objects or to make parts go through a specific sequence of machines. The template model provides the foundation for modeling classical scheduling problems such as job shop and open shop. 

<h2>Scenarios</h2>

In a manufacturing plant, a car must be assembled, polished, painted, finished using a pool of machines. A block of metal, need to go through different process (e.g. drill, polish, paint, roll, warm, cool down) and machines to be transformed in a finished product. A job must be processed in a given set of machines to be finished. Products are created in a production line with several machines, each one with its respective functionality and purpose in the whole process. Production line with alternative processing machines.

<h2>Applicability</h2>

Use this pattern when objects must be processed and altered through different machines so they can reach a desired internal state or a stage in the whole process. These object might have properties that are changes throughout the processing in the machines.

<h2>Model Representation</h2>

A class <i>Machine</i> represents the class of agent objects (e.g., driller, spray painter, rollers) that can process (e.g., alter their properties) object parts. The way machines execute and process the parts can be specified in the subclasses of Machines. That represents different types of machines and their particularities on processing the parts (set properties’ values). Each execution from a class of machine (e.g. drill, polish, paint, roll, warm, cool down) may require different constraints and resources. If there is no distinguish between machines then the execution process should be implemented in the top class Machine. The class <i>Part</i> represents the type of objects (e.g., part of a car, a metal block, a job, an artifact, data) that needs to be processed to a desirable form, or stage, or internal state. A part might have certain attributes that will be altered by the machines. Such attributes vary depending on the application. The goal is usually to achieve a certain values of these attributes. If different types of machine exits with different capabilities then the changes on the values will depend on the type of the machine that will process the part.<br>

In some application the order in which the machines are executed matters. That can be modeled in several ways. For example, the order can be constrained in the operator's  (preconditions and postconditions). This template model can also represent traditional scheduling problems such as job shop, open shop, and flow shop problems:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Job shop: the order of the machines to be executed can specified in the Part object as a list (e.g., a function that given a machine object as an entry it provides the next machine object to be executed). The execution of the object machines must follow the order specified (it is possible to store the next machine to be executed as a parameter so the object knows what must be executed next). As soon as it reaches the last machine in the list (the last machine can also be stored as an attribute of the part object), the part object becomes completed (e.g., an attribute call completed is set to true).</li>
<li>Open shop: the part object must go through some specific machines, but no order is specified. In this case the object attributes would be the completion of each specified machines.</li>
<li>Flow shop: every part must follow the same order of machines. In this case, it is possible to use an self-association on the class Machine (call ‘next’) that will specified the order of the machine objects. Every object can store which machine object it should go next to control in which stage in the machine chain it is at. As soon as the part object reaches the last machine in the order, it becomes completed, finished - the goal of the problem.</li>
</ul>
<p>
In scheduling problems, time must be specified for example for the pair (machine,part) or generally for each group of machine type.

<h2>Elements, Participants and Roles</h2>
<ul>

<li><b>Machine</b> (Class).  The class of agent objects that can process and alter the properties or stage of the part objects.</li>
<li><b>available</b> (property). The property that holds the availability of the machine. When its assigned to a part becomes not available, when it is not assigned then it is available.</li>
<li><b>assignpart</b> (operator, action schema). Operator that assigns a part to a machine so the machine can process the part.</li>
<li><b>Sub-classes of Machine</b> (e.g. MachineType1, MachineType2). These classes represents different kind of classes (if that is a requirement). Each one of them can have a different execution over the part.</li>
<li><b>execution operators</b> (operator, action schema. Actions that specified how parts changes after been processed by the given machine.</li>
<li><b>Part</b> (Class). The object that can be modified, changed an altered by machines.</li>
<li><b>waiting</b> (property). The property that holds whether part is waiting to be processed, i.e., it has not been assigned to any machine.</li>
<li><b>Attributes of Part</b> (e.g., attribute1, attribute2). Attributes that holds the current internal state of the object. They might be changed by the machines.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Metrics</h2>

The main metric for the template multiprocessing model is the number part manipulation, the size of the plan. However, this template can be extended so actions have duration in which, for example, each part takes a specific time to be processed by a specific machine. In such a scenario the makespan is of the main metrics. If resources are considered in the model to constrain the machine use, the usage of such resources are usually treated as metric.

<h2>Consequences</h2>

This pattern does not consider the time and additional resource (a worker, ink, supply material, etc) for processing parts. The model can be extended to handle these features though.
