<h1>Assembling</h1>

<h2>Intent</h2>

The purpose of the pattern is to model and represent agents that are able to assemble, build up or even disassemble more complex structures by combining different objects. The assembling process might involve the combination of composite objects (those formed by the composition of other objects) and atomic objects (those that havenâ€™t been combined yet). Objects must be assembled or disassembled in the right order to create the desirable object structures.

<h2>Scenarios</h2>

Combining different electronic components to create a computer. Combining pieces of a building block toy to create a bridge. Combining the wood parts to create a table. Combining the pillars, walls and roof to form the basic structure of a  house. Assembling the parts of a car which would require assembling several parts to create the engine which would then be assembled to the car frame, etc. Disassembling the engine for maintenance. 

<h2>Applicability</h2>

Use this pattern when objects have be assembled, composed to form more complex objects and structures or disassembled to reach the desirable structure. 

<h2>Model Representation</h2>

A class <i>Part</i> represents the type of objects that are assembled or disassembled by <i>Assemblers</i>. A part can be available to be incorporated to another part. To be available, a part is either an atomic part (i.e., it is not composed by other parts) that has not been incorporated yet or a composed part already assembled (all parts that belongs to it were already incorporated to it). A part is said to be assembled meaning that all its sub-parts were already incorporated to it. A part is said to be disassembled when all of its subparts were not incorporated to it. Each part can hold the information (constraints) about the order in which sub-parts must be incorporated. If the order constraint is not specified, the assembler can assemble them in any order. The class <i>Assembler</i> represents the type of agent objects that can perform the actual assembling or disassembling of parts. The assembler can only perform assembling or disassembling action when idle.<br>

<h2>Elements, Participants and Roles</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Assembler</b> (Class).  The class of objects that can assemble and disassemble parts.</li>
<li><b>idle</b> (property). The property that holds whether agent Assembler is idle or not.</li>
<li><b>assemble</b> (operator, action schema). The operation performed by an Assembler to assemble a part to its super part. The assembling process must respect the order in which part be assembled to its super-part. When all subparts were assembled, the super-part becomes assembled and available (for a higher level assembling).</li>
<li><b>disassemble</b> (operator, action schema). The operation performed by an Assembler to disassemble a part from its super part. The disassembling process must respect the same order used to assemble the parts. When all subparts were disassembled, the super-part becomes totally disassembled. The super-part becomes not available and not assembled as soon as the first subpart is removed.</li>
<li><b>Part</b> (Class, Role). The object that is assembled, composed, and disassembled by Assemblers.</li>
<li><b>partOf</b> (association). The relation between two Parts that represents that fact that a part belongs to another part, i.e., it is a subpart of a parent part.</li>
<li><b>incorporated</b> (association). The relation between two parts that represents that fact that a part is attached to another parent part.</li>
<li><b>available</b> (association). The property of a Part that represents its availability when assembling or disassembling. To be available, a part is either a atomic part (i.e., it is not composed by other parts) that has not been incorporated yet or a composed part already assembled (all parts that belongs to it were already incorporated to it).</li>
<li><b>assembled</b> (association). The property of a Part that represents the situation where all subparts are already incorporated.</li>
<li><b>disassembled</b> (association). The property of a Part that represents the situation where all subparts are no longer incorporated.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Metrics</h2>

The main metric for assembling problems is the number of part manipulations, the size of the plan. This pattern provides a base for more complicated reorganization problems such as the number of agents used, or the resource usage (if that is considered in the model).

<h2>Consequences</h2>

This pattern does not consider extra resources (e.g., tools) when assembling or disassembling parts. However the pattern can be extended to encompass that too. In the patterns the availability if the assembler agent is not used for controlling parallel, concurrent assembles, but it can be used for example in temporal models to control such an availability or even to control the situations when the agent may or may not perform assembling activities.

<h2>Known Uses</h2>

Examples of domains where this patterns can be found are the following:
<ul>
<li>Assembly (IPC-1)</li>
<li>Construction</li>
<li>Manufacturing</li>
</ul>
